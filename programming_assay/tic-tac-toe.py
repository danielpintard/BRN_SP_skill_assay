#    - this is essentially working how I would like it to, so I would just need to find a way to cancel the cpu_turn() and probably even the usr_turn() function AS SOON as game_over = True
# 2. I would like to implement some heading so that each round of the game can be distinguished and easy to determine in the terminal. This will be the ultimate beautifying effect for the game
# 3. I could consider making the cpu_turn() function smarter, but I don't know how serious that may be. If I make it any smarter, is there a way to avoid falling down a m,n,k game theory rabbit hole ðŸ˜¬?
#    - yeah bruh tbh this is the most boring game of tic tac toe ever, like the randomize function for the cpu is laughably abysmal and guarantees a winning option 9 times out of ten
#    - one interesting thing to think about in regards to this is that I can either make the cpu better at position placement OR better at defense. I wonder which would be easier to improve? I could do both but then I think I'd end up with google's level of impossible in their respective version of tic tac toe (which was torturously too good at tic tac toe)

# with this being the case, I may shift to the other parts of the assesment just to get a jumpstart since I'm still stuck on this part. But before the, lets spend some time thinking deeply about how to treat issue #1 (this may require some archetectural redesign)
